## Introduction

In my junior year of high school, I was selected for NASA's Highschool Aerospace Program where I participated in virtual chats with NASA engineers and scientists and completed an interactive online course on NASA activities related to space exploration, earth science, technology, and aeronautics directly related to the Artemis Generation and a mission to Mars. I also founded an all-girls eSports team at St. Agnes Academy dedicated to introducing and encouraging girls to play competitive videogames.

I currently am part of the AGGIENOVA Research team led by Texas A&M Professor Peter Brown. In this team, we study supernova explosions using ultraviolet and X-ray data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. I am currently working on the AGGIENOVA Templates project that combines photometry from the Open Supernova Catalog, including data from the Swift Optical Ultraviolet Supernova Archive, with rarer spectral UV-optical templates from the Hubble Space Telescope or theoretical models.

## Current Projects

### AGGIENOVA Template Project
I am currently working with AGGIENOVA at Texas A&M University to develop a [supernova template program](https://github.com/pbrown801/aggienova-templates/tree/abbie2). The purpose of the project is to create spectrophotometric time-series templates for supernovae.
